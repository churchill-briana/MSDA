# D208 - Predictive Modeling

## Course Overview

Predictive Modeling builds on initial data preparation, cleaning, and analysis, enabling students to make assertions vital to organizational needs. In this course, students conduct logistic regression and multiple regression to model the phenomena revealed by data. The course covers normality, homoscedasticity, and significance, preparing students to communicate findings and the limitations of those findings accurately to organizational leaders.

## Course Objectives

- **Logistic Regression:** The graduate employs logistic regression algorithms in describing phenomena.
- **Multiple Regression:** The graduate employs multiple regression algorithms with categorical and numerical predictors in describing phenomena.
- **Regression Implications:** The graduate makes assertions based on regression modeling.

## Assessment

### Task 1

This project required a research question be asked and answered using multiple regression. An initial multiple regression model was created, and then reduced by electing variables based on statistical justification. For this project I used backward step-wise elimination and checked the variance inflation factor to rule out statistically insignificant variables and high multicollinearity. I then created and assessed univariate and bivariate visualizations.

### Task 2

This project required a research question be asked and answered using logistic regression. An initial logistic regression model was created, and then reduced by electing variables based on statistical justification. For this project I Compared and reviewed the Akaike's Information Criteria, coefficients, p-values, and Pseudo R squared values in each model. The final values achievied were: Pseudo R squared: 0.3205, log-likelihood: -3929.2, LL-Null: -5782.2 and LLR p-value:0.000. I then created and assessed univariate and bivariate visualizations.
