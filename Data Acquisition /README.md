# D205 - Data Acquisition

## Course Overview

Data Acquisition builds proficiency in Structured Query Language (SQL) and the initial stages of the data analytics lifecycle. The course introduces relational databases. Students gain concrete skills in data transference and database manipulation.

## Course Objectives

- **Dimension, Quality Relations, and Limitations:** The graduate examines the data available for analysis to determine their dimension, quality, relations, and limitations.
- **Physical Data Models:** The graduate implements physical data models.
- **Table Operations:** The graduate performs table operations and queries within the context of data acquisition for analysis.

## Practical Assessment

D205 required one Practical Assessment completed by accessing a virtual machine and using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin to import an external CSV file into an existing database. The file was imported as a new table and the data explored via generated queries, as well as physical data models assessed in order to answer the following research question:

 “Are customers who give high ratings for courteous exchanges and respectful responses less likely to churn compared to customers who give low ratings?”

Customer responses are valuable for both the customer and the business. Customers may feel heard, and businesses may utilize this information to inform business decisions. This question specifically could be beneficial to the business when reviewing employee performances to ensure proper customer service. This question may also address a potential reason for churn rates, which could allow the business to make changes to possibly avoid such events.
