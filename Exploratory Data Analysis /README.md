# D207 - Exploratory Data Analysis

## Course Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis covers statistical principles supporting the data analytics life cycle. Students in this course compute and interpret measures of central tendency, correlations, and variation. The course introduces hypothesis testing, focusing on application for parametric tests, and addresses communication skills and tools to explain an analystâ€™s findings to others within an organization.

## Course Objectives

- **Data Interpretation:** The graduate interprets central tendency, correlations, and variation to inform organizational decisions.
- **Conducting Parametric Testing:** The graduate conducts parametric hypothesis testing.

## Assessment

This course has one Practical Assessment that builds on the previously cleaned dataset, in my instance - the telecommunications dataset. The project required that a research question be asked and a hypothesis tested by using either chi-square, t-test, or ANOVA techniques. Additionally, it was required to develop various univariate and bivariate statistics to describe the data. 

For the project I used chi-square statistic, p-value, and degree of freedom to determine whether technically inclined customers were more or less likely to churn compared to non-tech persons. I was able to confirm that the null hypothesis was rejected, and that the variables were not independent of each other. There was evidence that suggested the variables were related.
