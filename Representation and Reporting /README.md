## Assessment

Only one Practical Assessment was required for this course. For the project, I had to use the telecommunications dataset along with another external dataset of my choosing in order to generate data visualizations regarding the two datasets. From Kaggle, I retrieved the "Telco customer churn: IBM dataset.” and used it alongside the WGU provided dataset. Dashboards were created in Tableau to describe the data, alongside a video demonstration which was submitted as well.
