# D214 - MS Data Analytics Capstone

## Course Overview

The Data Analytics Graduate Capstone allows students to apply the academic and professional abilities developed as a graduate student. This capstone challenges students to integrate skills and knowledge from several program domains into one project.

This course has three Practical Assessments. 

## Course Objectives

- **Professional Readiness:** The graduate integrates and synthesizes competencies from across the degree program, thereby demonstrating the ability to participate in and contribute value to the chosen professional field.

## Assessment

### Task 1

This task was the foundation for Task 2 and 3, as it required that I propose a topic to research for my capstone project. Task 1 required a research question proposal which detailed where the data came from, the variables used, and null and alternative hypotheses for the study. The proposal included which techniques and tools I would use to gather, prepare, transform and analyze the data. Because the student finds the dataset on their own and proposes a research question of their own, WGU did provide a "retired topics" list to avoid. My proposed project was not on the retired list and I worked closesly with my course instructor so I was able to get my proposal accepted quickly so that I could move onto starting the analysis.

### Task 2

With the proposal approved, I cleaned and prepared my data for a Multiple Linear Regression on Salt Lake County Real Estate Prices. The goal of the project was to make predictions on Salt Lake's housing prices. In addition to creating the model and completing the analysis, I also wrote up a detailed report that explained each step taken throughout the process such as: collecting the data, cleaning and preparing the data, creating the model, outcomes and limitations of the analysis, and finally recommendations given the results. 

### Task 3

The final task required an executive summary describing the findings from the analysis. I wrote up an executive summary, which a non-technical audience could understand. Additionally, I created a Tableau dashboard alongisde a video demonstration explaining the dashboard and capstone project.
