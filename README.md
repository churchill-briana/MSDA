Welcome to my MSDA portfolio. The courses have been organized by the main topic covered, although each project will show that many additional topics, tool, and methodologies will be assessed throughout. Each folder contains any Tableau dashboards created and the written summaries submitted for each course which includes Python scripts or SQL queries used. Although not included in this portfolio, cleaned and transformed datasets were submitted as CSV files and video demonstrations of working code were submitted in addition when necessary. In each course folder I have given a small description of the course, which includes the "Course Overview" and "Course Objectives" described by WGU in the student portal. As well as my description of each project otherwise known as a *Performance Assessment Task*.
