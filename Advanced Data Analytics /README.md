## Course Overview

Advanced Data Analytics prepares students for career-long growth in steadily advancing tools and techniques and provides emerging concepts in data analysis. 
This course hones the mental and theoretical flexibility that will be required of analysts in the coming decades while grounding their approach firmly in ethical and organizational-need-focused practice. 
Topics include machine learning, neural networks, randomness, and unconventional data sources.

## Course Objectives

- **Time Series Analysis:** The graduate applies time series models in generating forecasts.
- **Neural Networks:** The graduate builds neural networks in the context of machine-learning modeling.
- **Natural Language Processing:** The graduate extracts insights from text data using effective and appropriate natural processing (NLP) models.

## Assessment

### Task 1

This project required a time series be used to anwer a research question posed by the student. My question was:
*"Using two years of available data, can accurate predictions be made regarding the daily revenue for WGU Teleco?"*
