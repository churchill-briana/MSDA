This course consisted of three tasks in which I created unsupervised predictive models.
K-Means Clustering was utilized to determine if there were better offerings to provide to particular customer segments in order to boost sales and increase tenure.
Another model was created using Principal Component Analysis to determine if such a method would be an appropriate dimensionality reduction measure.
And lastly, a market basket analysis was completed to determine if certain drug combinations with adverse reactions were be prescribed together amongst the patient's recently admitted to the hospital.
