This course consisted of three tasks in which I created unsupervised predictive models.
K-Means Clustering was utilized to determine if there were better offerings to provide to particular customer segments in order to boost sales and increase tenure.
Another model was created using Principal Component Analysis to determine if such a method would be an appropriate dimensionality reduction measure.
And lastly, a market basket analysis was completed to determine if certain drug combinations with adverse reactions were be prescribed together amongst the patient's recently admitted to the hospital.



# D212 - Data Mining II

## Course Overview

Data Mining II adds vital tools to the data analytics arsenal that incorporates unsupervised models. This course explains when, how, and why to use these tools to best meet organizational needs. 

## Course Objectives

- **Hierarchical & K-Means Clustering Techniques:** The graduate applies clustering techniques to accurately predict outcomes of interest.
- **Principal Component Analysis:** The graduate implements dimension reduction methods to identify significant variables.
- **Market Basket Analysis:** The graduate predicts patterns in data using association rules and lift analysis.

## Assessment

### Task 1

This project required the use of a clustering technique, to answer a research question created by the student. The question I posed was: *"Can distinct customer segments be identified using K-means?"*
 

### Task 2

This project required the use of Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.

### Task 3

For this project, I was finally able to switch away from the telecommunications dataset and work with the medical data instead. This project required the use of market basket analysis to answer a research question. My research question was: "Can drug combinations with adverse reactions be found amongst the strong relationships identified within the analysis?"
