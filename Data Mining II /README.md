# D212 - Data Mining II

## Course Overview

Data Mining II adds vital tools to the data analytics arsenal that incorporates unsupervised models. This course explains when, how, and why to use these tools to best meet organizational needs. 

## Course Objectives

- **Hierarchical & K-Means Clustering Techniques:** The graduate applies clustering techniques to accurately predict outcomes of interest.
- **Principal Component Analysis:** The graduate implements dimension reduction methods to identify significant variables.
- **Market Basket Analysis:** The graduate predicts patterns in data using association rules and lift analysis.

## Assessment

### Task 1

This project required the use of a clustering technique, to answer a research question created by the student. The question I posed was: *"Can distinct customer segments be identified using K-means?"* [The written submission for this assessment, which includes the Python code used, can be found here](https://github.com/churchill-briana/MSDA/blob/main/Data%20Mining%20II%20/Clustering%20Methods)
 
### Task 2

This project required the use of Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.[The written submission for this assessment, which includes the Python code used, can be found here](https://github.com/churchill-briana/MSDA/blob/main/Data%20Mining%20II%20/Principal%20Component%20Analysis)

### Task 3

For this project, I was finally able to switch away from the telecommunications dataset and work with the medical data instead. This project required the use of market basket analysis to answer a research question. My research question was: *"Can drug combinations with adverse reactions be found amongst the strong relationships identified within the analysis?"* [The written submission for this assessment, which includes the Python code used, can be found here](https://github.com/churchill-briana/MSDA/blob/main/Data%20Mining%20II%20/Lift%20Analysis)
