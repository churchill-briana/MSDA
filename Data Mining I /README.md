# D209 - Data Mining I

## Course Overview

Data Mining I expands predictive modeling into nonlinear dimensions, enhancing the capabilities and effectiveness of the data analytics lifecycle. In this course, learners implement supervised models—specifically classification and prediction data mining models—to unearth relationships among variables that are not apparent with more surface-level techniques. The course provides frameworks for assessing models’ sensitivity and specificity.

## Course Objectives

- **Classification Data Mining Models:** The graduate applies observations to appropriate classes and categories using classification models.
- **Predictive Data Mining MOdels:** The graduate implements prediction data mining models to find hard-to-spot relationships among variables.
- **Data Mining Model Performance:** The graduate evaluates data mining model performance for precision, accuracy, and model comparison.

## Assessment

### Task 1

The first Performance Assessment for this course requires that a research question be asked and answered using either K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) or Naive Bayes classification. 
For this project, I asked: "Could the k-nearest neighbor method be used to predict which customers may be at risk for churn in an effort to maximize customer retention rates?" I generated a KNN model with an accuracy score of 0.77 and an AUC score of 0.70.

### Task 2

The second Performance Assessment for this course requires that a research question be asked and answered using either decision trees, random forests, or advanced regression.
For this project, I asked: “using a Random Forest model, can a customer’s add-on services and demographics predict which internet service type that they will use?” [The submission for this assessment which includes the steps and Python code used, can be found here](https://github.com/churchill-briana/MSDA/blob/main/Data%20Mining%20I%20/Predictive%20Analysis)
