# D206 - Data Cleaning

## Course Overview

Data Cleaning continues building proficiency in the data analytics life cycle with data preparation skills. This course addresses exploring, transforming, and imputing data as well as handling outliers. Learners write code to manipulate, structure, and clean data as well as to reduce features in data sets.

## Course Objectives

- **Predicting Obstacles in Data Analysis:** The graduate predicts potential obstacles in data analysis based on the quality of data provided.
- **Preparing Data for Analysis:** The graduate prepares data for analysis to address organizational needs.
- **Manipulating Data for Analysis:** The graduate writes reusable code to manipulate and clean data in preparation for analysis.

## Assessment

This course requires one Practical Assessment in which one of two datasets is chosen to clean. For this project, I chose to clean the telecommunications CSV file. In addition to cleaning the data, a research question must be answered and a Principal Component Analyis completed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. Because the telecommunications file was chosen for this assessment, this data and similar datasets will be utilized throughout the majority of the program per WGU's program guidelines.
